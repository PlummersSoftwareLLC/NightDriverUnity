NightDriverUnity
================

The NightDriveUnity project is really a "demo" of how to create a server applicaion, in this case using C# an Unity, to drive NightDriverStrip instances remotely by WiFi.

You are welcome and encouraged to party and adapt this code as needed.  My hope for this little project is that it can grow into something useful for people, enabling them to write LED control code in Unity rather than more complex environments.

Adding more demos of how to do things (signs, candles, flames, etc) would be a great way to flesh this project out further.

The one issue I've run into with Unity is that when it does not have the focus, your app will not run reliably in the background.  I would be very indebted to anyone who can figure that one out!
